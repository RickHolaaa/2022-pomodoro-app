# Project-1

## Ideas :
- Create a pomodoro website/APP(soon) in which you can add also a to-do list during your sessions

## Languages used :
- HTML : to create the corpse of the website
- CSS : to make the website better-looking
- JS : to include the algorithm of to-do list & tomodoro
- PHP (soon) : to create a panel, add a history of the sessions, ...

## Pomodoro principe :
- Input a hour, minute, second into 3 variables
- Get the current time
- While the current time isn't the same than these 3 variables : don't do anything
- When the asked time is reached, close the loop
